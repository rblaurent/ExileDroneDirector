# Enhanced DevKit Findings

Status: active reconnaissance log
Target: Conan Exiles Enhanced Dev Kit, Unreal Engine 5.6.1

## Installation identity

The Epic library contains two similarly named products. They are not
interchangeable:

| Product | Expected engine | Suitable for this project |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Conan Exiles Dev Kit | Unreal Engine 4.15.x | No; Legacy only |
| Conan Exiles Enhanced Dev Kit | Unreal Engine 5.6.1 | Yes |

On 2026-08-08, an installation at `F:\ConanExilesDevKit` was verified as the
Legacy kit using all of the following local evidence:

- Epic display name: `Conan Exiles Dev Kit`
- Epic namespace/app: `conanexiles` / `ConanExiles`
- Launch executable: `Engine/Binaries/Win64/UE4Editor.exe`
- `Engine/Build/Build.version`: `4.15.3`
- Content root: `Games/ConanSandbox/Content/Mods`

It was rejected before any Exile Drone Director asset was created. The Enhanced
kit is being installed separately under a distinct `F:` path.

## Mandatory verification before project creation

Do not create, copy, sync, open, resave, or cook project assets until all checks
pass:

1. Epic display name is exactly `Conan Exiles Enhanced Dev Kit`.
2. `Engine/Build/Build.version` reports engine major `5`, minor `6`.
3. A writable mod root exists at `UE4/Content/Mods` or the current Enhanced
   documentation's replacement path.
4. The editor launches with the Enhanced Conan project and exposes the mod menu.
5. The generated mod folder and `modinfo.json` are recorded before adding assets.

`tools/Sync-DevKitContent.ps1` independently enforces the engine-major/minor
check. A path merely containing the word `Enhanced` is not accepted as proof.

## Confirmed Enhanced documentation assumptions

- The Enhanced DevKit is based on Unreal Engine 5.6.1.
- Existing UE4 mod concepts remain relevant, but assets and cooked packages are
  not cross-compatible.
- Mod-owned assets remain isolated under the selected mod's Content/Mods root.
- The Mod Controller remains the supported hub for component attachment and
  data-table merging unless local inspection proves an Enhanced-specific change.

## Pending local reconnaissance

- Exact Enhanced project and content paths
- Mod creation output and metadata schema
- Mod Controller parent class and component-copy rules
- Owning client player/controller attachment candidate
- Input binding strategy
- Camera and Cine Camera Blueprint exposure in cooked runtime
- PIE and cook commands/output locations
- Authenticated server identity and persistence APIs
