# Blueprint graph tooling

The Enhanced DevKit exposes Blueprint assets, variables, components, compile,
and save operations to Python, but it does not expose concrete K2 node creation.
Exile Drone Director therefore uses Unreal's native Blueprint clipboard format
for reviewed batches of graph nodes.

The tools in this directory never launch Unreal:

- `Export-BlueprintGraphClipboard.ps1` captures selected nodes copied from the
  Blueprint editor into a normalized `.eddgraph` source file.
- `Test-BlueprintGraphSnippet.ps1` validates node boundaries, identifiers,
  internal links, node classes, and the mod namespace.
- `Set-BlueprintGraphClipboard.ps1` resolves explicit `{{TOKEN}}` placeholders
  and places the graph on the Windows clipboard for pasting in Unreal.

Authoritative workflow and safety rules live in
`docs/blueprint-workflow.md`.
